However, Bronxites currently do not have enough meaningful ownership or control over our futures. To ensure existing residents who fought for the Bronx can continue to call it home for generations to come, a coalition of Bronx organizations is engaging residents and local stakeholders in the creation of a Bronx-wide Platform and Plan to establish a community-driven, comprehensive vision for economic development rooted in advancing racial justice and economic democracy."}</p>
